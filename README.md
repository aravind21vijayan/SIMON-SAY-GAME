# SIMON SAYS GAME

This is a web-based implementation of the classic electronic memory game "Simon Says". The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

## How to Play

1.  **Start the Game:** Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
2.  **Watch the Sequence:** Simon will give the first signal. A button will flash.
3.  **Repeat the Sequence:** Click the button that flashed.
4.  **Simon Adds On:** If you were correct, Simon will repeat the first signal and add a new one.
5.  **Keep Playing:** Continue repeating the sequences as long as you can. The sequence gets longer with each round.
6.  **Game Over:** If you click the wrong button, the game will end. Your score for that round will be displayed.
7.  **Track Your High Score:** The game will keep track of your highest score across all rounds.
8.  **Restart:** To play again, press any key to restart the game.
